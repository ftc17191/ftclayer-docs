# What are ticks, and how do they work with encoders.

Encoders are used to measure the position and speed of a motor, however they do not use inches and centimeters like you or me. They use a special unit called ticks.

Ticks are a divison of a single rotation on a motor. There can be many ticks per rotation, or not many. The amount of ticks depends on the motor being used.

Check your motors manufacturers webpage to see the amount of ticks per rotation on your motor.

So using ticks we can tell the motor the amount of ticks to rotate, or the rate of ticks at which to rotate.

Velocity and Go To Position use ticks.
