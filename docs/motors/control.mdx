# Controlling motors

To control motors you have 3 options.

1. Power
2. Run to position
3. Velocity

Let me break down what each one is.

## Power

All motors use power in some form, using power to control your robot directly changes the amount of
electricity being sent to your robot.


## Run to Position

Many motors have little trackers in the called encoders. Encoders measure how far a motor has moved, and the speed of
the movement. Encoders can also be used to set how far something a motor should turn and then stay at that spot. Encoders
are similar to servos in that they can be used to go to a specific location accurately.


## Velocity

Using encoders, Velocity can be used to set the speed of a motor instead of setting the amount of power that goes to a
motor which results in much more accurate and consistent speeds.

For example, you can set the motor to go 4 kilometers per hour, instead of just giving it power.


## Which on should I use?

If you are controlling the specific position of a motor, or want to create boundaries for which the motor can
not move past, use (Go to Position)[./go-to-position].
