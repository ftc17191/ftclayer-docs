# Controlling a motor with velocity

All motors use power. However, the downside with directly controlling the power is that you can't
give the motor an exact speed for it to follow.

For example, lets say we give a motor .5 power. It will run at about half of full speed, but we cant really get an exact speed. Heres where velocity comes in.

Using velocity, we can set the motor run to at a certain number of Ticks per Minute, or Rotations per Minute. 

> Don't know what ticks are? (Click Here)[./ticks]!

To set a motors velocity using Ticks per Minute, use the following line:

```java
motor.setMotorVelocityTPM(100);
```

The example will move our motor to go 100 Ticks per MInute.
