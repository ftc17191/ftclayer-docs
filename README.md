# FTC Layer Documentation

FTCLayer's documentation is built on Facebook's excellent project **Docusaurus**.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributions to the docs, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ftc17191/ftclayer-docs.git && cd ftclayer-docs
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Start a development server

```
npm run dev
```

Once the server has started, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The first time you hit the page, loading will take a while as Docusaurus builds the frontend and backend. This is only an issue with the local development server.

## Development

Docusaurus is built on MDX, meaning you can use a combination of Markdown and React. Learn more about Docusaurus's formatting [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Contributing

Once you have finished your work, you can submit a pull request to the repository and, if approved, it will be merged and published to the live site.
